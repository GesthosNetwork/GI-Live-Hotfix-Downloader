## GI Live Hotfix Downloader

**GI Live Hotfix Downloader** is a tool for managing and verifying Live Hotfix data patches downloaded when you log in to the game. Typically, these patches are located in the `GenshinImpact_Data/Persistent` folder. Some data will delete in the next update. So, If we don't backup live updates (suffixes and versions from query region info), we will loose cool data forever.
